# Project Title
KnapsackGeneticAlgorithm


## Getting Started
First step you must have JAVA in your OS and compiler project.
after then you can run the project easiy.

## Inputs

`AGE` is a variable carry the Generation of your problem.
`itemcount` is a variable and its a size of your knapsack.
`weight_of_knapsack` is a variable and its weight of your knapsack.
`populationSize` is a variable and its size of your population in genetic algorithm.

```
 int age = 1000000;
 int itemcount = 100;
 int weight_of_knapsack = 400;
 int populationSize = 800;
```
after program will be request you to enter your objects weight and they profit.

## Output

`best.fitness()` a integer number ,Maximum of profit.
